Significant Linear Hotspot Detection with HPC Techniques

The circular hotspot techniques which work on euclidean space may miss significant paths since a large fraction of an area 
bounded by shapes in euclidean space for activities on a path will be empty.

So we have done with curvilinear hotspot detection as part of my BTP work.
